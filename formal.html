        <h>Formal Research project</h>
        <p>I started with using things such as SIRS Researcher, and GALE to obtain credible sources, and to figure out how I was going to structure the project. After gathering together multiple sources, I began writing with many issues. To begin, I didn’t know where to start. Whilst writing the first paragraph, I determined that it would be extremely difficult to meet the lengthy word requirement, and I was forced to find more and more sources. If I had to go back I would definitely begin with gathering a plethora of sources, and preparing content for each source. Given that I know a thing or two about business, I figured out the best thing to do was to use what I already know and back up my claims with credible sources. The sources I found ranged from academic journals to scholarly articles, and in using such advanced sources, I believe that my paper gained and extreme amount of credibility.</p>
        <p>By the time I was 75% done with my paper, I had run out of content to put in the paper. I had said everything I wanted to say, and then some, and I was at a crossroad. My two choices were accept the markdown, or find more sources to talk about, I chose the latter. As previously stated, finding sources (and a lot of them) is extremely beneficial to the paper, and doing it beforehand is also very nice because it helps not having to break the pace that you’re working at to find more content. Looking back, I know that the best thing to do would be to find my sources, read through them, gain an understanding about what they are trying to convey, and writing the paper based on your findings. Another thing I found to be critical was to make sure the content was not too dry, as to put off readers. Getting a research project to be exciting is a very hard thing to do, and it requires dedication. </p>
        <p>The writing process of the formal research project was very strenuous, and took quite a while. Articulating my thoughts in a meaningful way, as to convey a message that was both insightful and entertaining was a hard task to accomplish, but through writing that paper, I learned a few ways to do just that. Using personal experience was a big one, showing that I know firsthand what something is like, and then showing that some professional in the field knows the same thing, I established myself as knowledgeable and trustworthy on the subject matter, and brought the readers to believe what I say as the truth. Another thing to do is to try to simplify the content so that it doesn’t go over people’s heads. To do this, I attempted to tone down the vocabulary that I used, and the paper came across much more friendly as a result of that. By the end of the paper, I believe that I taught the reader valuable lessons about business, and how it works both on a scholarly level, and on an individual level as well. If I were to go back, I would definitely cut out some unnecessary content, as to remove some fat, so to speak. Oversaturating the content with additional sentences, and unneeded clauses just made the project as a whole much less pleasant to read. To anyone going into this project I say to you, pace yourself, take your time finding credible sources, make sure that your content is appropriate for what you’re trying to convey, and don’t wait until the last minute.</p>
        <p>The project also requires us to interview people who are in the field and professor who study this discipline. This is also a researching task that each of the students has to search their own major. The major that I wrote about was economist. Some of the communication way that I have found was using Scholarly journals or articles. My first interview was done with my father who is an analyst in South Korea over 30years in the field. He stated that most of the economists use the articles to communicate with each other. The articles not only include just a news articles, but also the articles that other economist, reporter, or even politicians wrote. However, the sources and the communication would mostly be done with the articles that economist wrote. By using this information from articles, each economist states their ideas on each of their area. Some agree and some disagree with the articles statement. Others make their own theory to argue some of the topic. For example, when new product from Samsung is produced, there will be articles coming out in magazine or in news website. Economist will read them and write their own opinion about the cause and effect about this new phone’s release. This article will be out in the press as well and will be read by another economist to agree or disagree with the article. By cycles around, this forms a communication within economists. Another interview was done with Mr.Ballard from economy department. He is currently a professor of Michigan State University and a director of State of the State Survey. He stated that there are many different methods that he uses other than articles. First is to release the books that economist wrote about their theory and idea about certain topic. This work just like articles but more detailed. He also said using mathematical formulas would be another method. Even though not every economist fit into the formula that they have created, the economy will shape similarly with the formulas that they have formed. </p>

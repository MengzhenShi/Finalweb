      <h1>Formal Research project</h1>
        <p>The project also requires us to interview people who are in the field and professor who study this discipline. This is also a researching task that each of the students has to search their own major. Some students started with using things such as SIRS Researcher, and GALE to obtain credible sources, and to figure out how he was going to structure the project. After gathering together multiple sources, he began writing with many issues. To begin, he didn’t know where to start. Whilst writing the first paragraph, he determined that it would be extremely difficult to meet the lengthy word requirement, and he was forced to find more and more sources. If he had to go back he would definitely begin with gathering a plethora of sources, and preparing content for each source. Given that he knows a thing or two about business, he figured out the best thing to do was to use what he already know and back up my claims with credible sources. The sources he found ranged from academic journals to scholarly articles, and in using such advanced sources, he believes that his paper gained and extreme amount of credibility.</p>
        <p>From this project, there were multiple ideas that could be learned. Developing the knowledge of your own about researching your major is the primitive thing to do. University is the place that people find what they are good at and what they are bad at. This project requires us to look for the directly. For example, people have their own likes and dislikes. Some people like Marketing class and some people like advertisement. By looking for their way for communication method, they will feel that they like their major. This project also could be the key factor or turning point for some students after they have finished their project. </p>
        <p>Some people have done economic and some students have done marketing for their major and their job was to meet the professors who are in their field. The question that some students ask was the communication method. For example, the major that Seungpyo wrote about was economist. Some of the communication way that I have found was using Scholarly journals or articles. His first interview was done with my father who is an analyst in South Korea over thirty years in the field. His father stated that most of the economists use the articles to communicate with each other. The articles not only include just a news articles, but also the articles that other economist, reporter, or even politicians wrote. However, the sources and the communication would mostly be done with the articles that economist wrote. By using this information from articles, each economist states their ideas on each of their area. Some agree and some disagree with the articles statement. Others make their own theory to argue some of the topic. Like this, depending on each major, they have whir own method of communication. Some could be very similar and some could be very different. Students who are about to take this course should realize that researching and interview could be the most important factor in this part because this project rquires to write the facts based on what they have researched. If the information is miss understood or written differently, they should rethink their writing.  </p>
        <h>Student opinion on formal research project </h>
        <p>The formal research paper was a very exhausting yet rewarding assignment. It was the longest paper we had to write, 2700 words, and took many hours to complete. The purpose of this assignment was to give students who are new to the academic discipline, mine being economics, an introduction to the expectations for writing, reading, and researching in that discipline. I knew that I had to write about economics but needed to narrow it down into a narrower topic. By using the MSU’s electronic online database, I was able to find multiple articles and sources that I was able to use for my project. I planned everything out for the days that I worked on it, what steps and even did an outline as to how my project would be formatted. There were tons of articles for my topic and I was proud of the articles I sued for my assignment. Economics is used in everyday life and people underestimate the importance for economics in everything. There were challenges to find time for my interviews with my own favorite professor until near the deadline for the assignment. I did find an issue with developing the questions that I was going to ask them. I decided to come up with a list of questions, and I just asked them those. Overall, my interviews went well, and they allowed me to expand my paper into something much more meaningful than it already was. I used many sites in my project for different pictures, graphs, and quotes. This report gave me the opportunity to begin building my own understanding how writing, reading, and researching operate within a discipline of interest to me. There were points were I wasn’t sure about what to write about next, because 2,700 words is a lot f information to write about and needed to find more basic knowledge about economics to fill in my report. My paper was to help your audience understand the ways that literacy’s (both technological and rhetorical) are used to create and communicate knowledge in the field of economics.</p>
        <p>The formal research paper was not a particularly hard paper to write. The only thing about it was that it was long and took a long time to write and get everything together. That was probably the hardest part, making sure that you had good time management with everything and didn’t just slack off until the end. I was able to do this pretty successfully. I had everything planned out, when I was going to do my interview, when I would need all my articles by and when I would start writing the paper. I tried to do my interviews as early as I could so I could get my information together and find an argument or point of the paper. I think I did the interviews about two weeks before the paper was due. Then I tried to find articles that would go along with my argument. This was a bit of a harder task. There were tons of articles on my topic, which was actuarial science, but a lot of them had to do with the negatives of actuarial science and my paper’s purpose was to get people informed about what actuarial science is and try to convince them to become actuaries. For this reason obviously none of the negative articles would work so it took a little time to find these good articles. After I found what I thought would be enough articles I started to write the paper. I started writing the paper about 3 days before it was due so that I wouldn’t have to cram the whole thing into one night but it wasn’t too much time to where everyday I would be like “oh I still have 5 days I can just skip today,” you have to find that balance because as soon as you get into the mindset of “skipping” days of working you will just keep skipping until the last day it is due. That is where you will get screwed. If you try to cram this paper into one night of work you will never get it done in time and the stuff that you do get done will be very low quality thus leading to a very bad grade. So the big tip I would give to anyone that has to write this paper would be to manage their time wisely and do not get behind because as soon as you get behind there will be an avalanche of work following you and you will never want to start working on it because there will be so much to get done, only adding to the work that has to get done.</p>
        <h>Conclusion </h>
        <p>The Formal Research project was quite challenging, and quite fulfilling. Learning the best ways to create a paper that educates others on a topic that you enjoy is extremely satisfying, given that it involved my own personal experience, and other more established individuals. The challenges along the way ranged from arranging an interview to fulfilling the word count, though I managed to complete both of those requirements without an issue. Overall the paper was an extremely good learning lesson about time management, and paper development skills. Finding sources that were both credible and relevant was a very hard challenge, and required strenuous searching through databases for useful information, and lengthy web searching. My time devotion and willingness to find good information coalesced into an extremely well rounded paper, and I was taught a valuable lesson in writing a formal paper. Aligning the interviews was very difficult, as I had people that were more than willing to be interviewed. However, I did find an issue with developing the questions that I was going to ask them. I decided to come up with a list of questions, and I just asked them those. The problem with having a list, though, is the environment feels less organic, and the replies reflect that in spades. Overall, my interviews went well, and they allowed me to expand my paper into something much more meaningful than it already was. The formal research project was a learning experience more than anything, and without it, I believe that I would not have some of the skills required to advance onto higher level writing classes.</p>

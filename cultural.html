      <h>Course Retrospective: Cultural Analysis  </h>
      <p>Assignment number two came quickly, and this time, it was all about mixing popular artifacts with a common social issue that exists today. This project required us to make a further step towards a more formal type of writing.  Achieving this was done by a few fairly simple tasks. First and foremost was taking into consideration a major social issue and analyzing it; that was the most important part. Next came finding and describing a piece of technology that represented that social issue clearly and thoroughly. The last step was to provide a possible solution to the issue that was at hand. Aside from all the required information that needed to be incorporated, it was also fundamental to carefully consider the audience to make sure that the understanding of the main message would be complete. </p>
      <p>Discussing a social issue can be a very risky task; people have diverse and polar opposite opinions on such things, so it is important to keep the audience in mind while describing the issue.  This means it is truly fundamental that the audience is helped to avoid, or remove, any biases, as in fact the social issue described in the paper is mainly born out of people’s biases. The best way to avoid such biases while investigating a social issue is to focus more on research rather than a single opinion. Showing how you can see both sides is a good way to get your point across without making them feel like you’re right and they are wrong if they feel differently. </p>
      <p>To better our writings, the class was introduced to a video from South Park, which went over a social issue and showed how they overcame the issue. By watching and responding to the video, it helped show that themes are important to focus on while writing a paper that is based upon analysis, and that it is important to include a clear introduction of the points to cover. Finding and describing a piece of technology to help support the described issue was a fun and creative part of this assignment. One good example of using an artifact to explain your issue at hand is Hanzhang Shi’s illustration. “There are various kinds of heroic games and movies that are popular nowadays. As a result, a lot of people would act just like the hero in the video games or the movies and try to do everything by themselves. However, single hero will never be stronger than a team. The computer game World of Warcraft addresses the importance of teamwork over being one single hero.” Though this is just one of the many contradictory topics that may be used, it is a very good example. </p>
      <p>Along with the basics previously described, it was necessary to include an executive summary for the project. The importance of the summary is common to that as an abstract. The executive summary includes the main purpose and argument, introduction to things that would be later addressed, not to mention the artifact used to help support your ideas, and also brief descriptions of the conclusion. This summary had a huge significance to the project and is a common literacy that is used in technical writings that commonly analyze different sorts of issues and ideas.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, the purpose of the cultural analysis project was to elaborate on a social issue and its importance on society through the use of a cultural artifact. Getting somebody to see your side of the story is hard without anything to back up your point with. This gave students a great opportunity to discuss something they felt strongly about and to give an example they were familiar with to support their topic. It was overall a great assignment, with a lot of freedom to write about any desire or passion, as well as teaching students how to efficiently write persuasively!</p>

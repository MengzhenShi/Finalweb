      <h1>Lived Experience</h1>
         <h>Abstract</h>
         <p>Lived experiences project, which was the first project assigned to us was a new type of writing.</p>
         <p>This project required us to create a narrative explaining how a specific piece of technology has impacted our choice of our fields of studies. </p>
         <p>This is different than any other typical writing project, due to the fact that it required us to write about our own personal experiences and opinions about our visions and goals. Further, it also linked them to the reasons of choosing our majors. </p>
         <p>In addition, the minimum required number of words was at least 1200, which was relatively high amount or number for an experience report.</p>
         <p>Our purpose of this project is to identify both intra and interpersonal experiences within lived experience projects. As a group, we have discussed what we have learned from this project, especially how to lay out an academic writing. Apart from academic aspects, we also enjoyed the project as it was a sole opportunity to express our lifetime experiences. </p>
         <h1>Main</h1>
         <p>Through this project, we learned how to write in detail. The university-required writing skills were much different to what we were required to write for our secondary education. Lived experience project was the first project we encountered throughout the course. The project required us to write down our personal perspectives and experiences, thus it was a different style of writing we were facing.</p>
         <p>Writing in detail was a major challenge for all of the students. Because the minimum required number of words were 1200, which was relatively large amount for a topic regarding personal experiences. As a result, our writing became highly repetitive. Dr. Daniels helped us a lot with fixing those problems.</p>
         <p>Since it required personal experiences, we had to write a narrative style of writings. Most of us were used to writing and discussing a given topic. Thus, we always wrote as a third person’s view. However, through lived experiences, we changed the view point from third person to first person. We wrote as a formal version of personal diaries. The essay was very likely to be informal, and our main goal was not to make the essay informal, but yet narrative.</p>
         <p>Also, because we had to recall our memories from past, it was important for us to describe our moments well. This was a hard part for us as our generation uses photos and videos to describe a past moment, however because we were asked to describe in words, we had to think thoroughly and deeply regarding our memory.</p>
         <p>The significant difference between ordinary writing projects we encountered and the lived experience projects from the WRA 110 was the presence of the web version. For our projects, we were asked to provide a web version of our projects. Unlike other web making sources, the page “github” was using the fundamental HTML sources to make a web page. For students who did not know how to make a homepage, this was a great challenge. However, Dr. Daniels helped us a lot to make and fix the webpages.</p>
         <h1>Main(Non-academics)</h1>
         <p>We also found out that technology affected our goals and visions. As we wrote about our own life experiences, we got to organize our pasts. At the end of the project, each of student had a clear goal and visions about their lives. Many students forget their initial mind set they used to have upon their arrival to universities. In terms of motivation through their lives, acknowledging their initial motivation is crucial upon one’s success. Through the project, many students were able to recall their promises they made before universities.</p>
         <p>When reading other students’ writings, we were able to indirectly experience what others went through in their lives. Each student had a valid reason of their choices of majors, and by reading them we were able to widen our knowledge. This also helped us to develop our understandings of others, which may act as a crucial skill as a society member.</p>
         <h1>Conclusion</h1>
         <p>This project has allowed us to develop our writing skills from a first person’s view, which was a new style of writing for all of us. However, Dr. Daniels allowed us to express our own thoughts and framed our overall quality and quantity of our writings. With Dr. Daniels’ help, we were able to achieve our maximum ability as students both academically and non-academically. For the other projects followed after Lived Experience, the lived experience project acted as a keystone to build our writing skills. </p>

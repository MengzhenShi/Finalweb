        <p>The remix project was a fun project. The project was about making a documentary about a topic that we had written about in the past. My team and I chose to work on a topic about shopping addiction. This project required a team to work on a topic they would enjoy researching about so my team and I voted and came up with shopping addiction. Future students looking into doing this kind of project should choose a topic they enjoy for a lot of time will be spend researching and talking to people about the project. Time management was also key for this project.  At the beginning it will seem like there is a lot of time to work on the project, but as the deadline approaches it will seem like there is a lot of work to be done. This will involve interviewing people, learning how to use i-movies and acting in the documentary. For my project topic we had to travel to the mall to shoot some of the scenes in the mall and this was very time consuming. I would advise starting early in this project and also giving each team member a task to get done. However the whole experience was very rewarding as I ended up knowing new people and learning about shopping addiction and what causes it and this opened my mind to issues I had never gave a thought. I would advise future students to just have fun with this project and also learn something because the experience is worth.</p>
